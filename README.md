# Django Poll App and Authentication

This is a Django-based web application that provides polling functionality and user authentication. It consists of three main components:
- **personal**: Contains personal information pages (such as 'About Me' and 'Index' pages).
- **polls**: Allows users to create polls, vote, and view results.
- **user_auth**: Handles user authentication, including registration, login, and logout functionality.

The project is set up to run with both a **virtual environment** (`venv`) and **Docker** for easier deployment.
