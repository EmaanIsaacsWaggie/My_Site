Initially, I attempted to use the previous capstone task for this project, but I encountered several issues with untracked and unmerged files that caused significant conflicts during version control operations. Despite several attempts to resolve these conflicts, I found that the repository had become too complicated and challenging to manage effectively.
After consulting with one of the mentors, I was advised to abandon the previous task and use a new, cleaner task as a replacement. This has allowed me to start fresh, with fewer issues, and to make steady progress on the project.
